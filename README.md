Codecademy JavaScript - Random Message Generator - Portfolio Project

Description:
-----------
The purpose of the project is to design a message generator. Each time you click run (in Visual Studio Code), the messages will print in a random order.

This has helped me to understand JavaScript Syntax a little better, for Codecademy's Full Stack Developer course, 
whilst practicing, creating arrays, string interpolation, and pushing code to GitHub through the terminal.

Technologies:
------------
I have used Visual Studio Code  for my Text Editor and Node.js - script.

Instructions:
------------
If you would like to see the first random test - remove the comment marks /* */ on lines number 2 and 6 to see the single element,
being tested.

Next if you would like to see the correct string sentence printed remove the comment marks /* */ on lines 35 and 73

This is a portfolio work in progress piece.
Thank you
